## some brief notes

Smart contract
It is code as law. The code executes the terms of a contract and cannot be altered.
- immutable, runs on the blockchain (decentralized distributed computing system) state changes take place only when the majority agrees
- highly secure
- needs extreme care because code is not editable once on the blockchain.
